# Analog Circuit Design: Beta Multiplier, Cascode Current Mirror, and Cascode Amplifier
This project involves the design and simulation of key analog building blocks-**Beta Multiplier**, **Cascode Current Mirror**, and **Cascode Amplifier**-in both **180nm** and **22nm CMOS technology nodes** using **LTspice** for simulation and **Magic VLSI** for layout (180nm only).
## Objective
- Design and simulate:
- Cascode Current Mirror
- Cascode Amplifier
- Perform simulations in both **180nm** and **22nm** CMOS technology.                              - Verify key specifications: gain, power dissipation, and unity gain bandwidth (UGB).
- Create corresponding layouts (for 180nm) in Magic VLSI.
  
## Tools Used
- LTspice – Circuit simulation
- Magic VLSI  – Layout design (for 180nm)
- Technology: 180nm and 22nm CMOS
