# Analog Circuit Design: Beta Multiplier, Cascode Current Mirror, and Cascode Amplifier
This project involves the design and simulation of key analog building blocks—**Beta Multiplier**, **Cascode Current Mirror**, and **Cascode Amplifier**—in both **180nm** and **22nm CMOS technology nodes** using **LTspice** for simulation and **Magic VLSI** for layout (180nm only).
